    <h1>The Simple Joy of Slow Mornings</h1>
    <p>
      There’s something magical about mornings that start without a rush. The gentle clink of a spoon against a coffee mug, 
      the quiet hum of a world just beginning to stir—these small things carry a kind of peace we often overlook.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Slowing Down Matters</h2>
    <p>
      In a world that constantly demands speed, slowing down is almost rebellious. 
      But it’s in those quiet pockets of time that our minds reset, our creativity returns, and our hearts find rhythm again.
    </p>

    <h3>Start With One Thing</h3>
    <p>
      Maybe it’s a walk. Maybe it’s writing down your thoughts. 
      Whatever it is, choose one thing that helps you begin your day on your terms—not the world’s.
